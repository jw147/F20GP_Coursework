A fighter pilot has been forced to eject from his airplanewhilst flying over a zombie quarantine zone in Japan.
He has landed in the quarantine zone with his pistol and a few rounds of ammunition.

# Assets
The pistol, trees, zombies, gong and textures were all imported from Unity's asset store. Most sound assets were made into MP3 files from youtube videos and trimmed if necessary. Gun and gong animations were create by me. The terrain was made from Unity's Terrain Tool and textured with multiple asset packs from the Unity store.
